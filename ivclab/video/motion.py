        Computes the motion vector that describes the motion between the single channeled reference image and the current image.
        The motion vector is represented as a 2D numpy array with shape [H / 8, W / 8, 1], where the x and y displacements
        are converted to a single value using the formula: motion_vector = y_displacement * (2 * search_range + 1) + x_displacement. Notice that
        displacements can take any value in the range [-search_range, search_range]. We compute the motion vectors only for
        the 8x8 non-overlapping blocks. Compute the closest indice using sum of the squared differences (SSD) between the reference block and the current block.
